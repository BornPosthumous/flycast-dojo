<h3></b><a name="romset">What is the preferred romset?</a></h3>

<p>For the BIOSes, we use <code>awbios.zip</code> and <code>naomi.zip</code> validated against RetroArch's <a href="https://github.com/libretro/libretro-database/blob/master/dat/System.dat">System.dat</a> file. This should serve as a standard for all system BIOSes used. Dreamcast games use Flycast's built-in HLE BIOS by default.</p>

<p>As a general rule, players use the <b>MAME 0.218</b> romset for NAOMI games, and the <b>MAME 0.226</b> romset for Atomiswave games. For Dreamcast games, CHD files based on the Redump set are preferred. You may also look at the included <code>flycast_roms.json</code> file to see a list of filenames and checksums corresponding with the current preferred ROMs as well.</p>

<p>For more information on specific games, try asking on the relevant <a href="community.html">Community Discord</a>. They typically know what is best for competition play at any point in time.</p>

<a name="where-bios" /><h3>Where do I put my BIOS & ROMs?</h3>

<p>For the BIOS, be sure to add <code>awbios.zip</code> for Atomiswave games or <code>naomi.zip</code> for NAOMI games into your <code>data</code> directory in the folder you have Flycast installed. In your settings, the folder Flycast is installed in is your <b>Home Directory</b>.</p>

<p>If you are running Fightcade, you can find the ROMs folder at <code>Fightcade\emulator\flycast\ROMs</code>. Non-Fightcade users can use the included <code>ROMs</code> directory, or specify any other folder as a <b>Content Directory</b> in the settings.</p>

<a name="button-6" /><h3>When I map my controller, why am I unable to map Button 6 (Hard Kick / 2nd Assist) ?</h3>

<p>It's likely that the button you are trying to set is configured as an axis input on your controller. On the right hand side of the controller mapping screen, there is a section called <b>Analog Axes</b>. Find the button you want to map, and try to assign it again.</p>

<a name="analog-joy" /><h3>How do I map my analog joystick to the directions?</h3>

<p>On the <b>Analog Axes</b> side of your controller mapping screen, find <b>DPad X</b> for horizontal movement, and <b>DPad Y</b> for vertical movement. Once you click on <b>Map</b>, flick the joystick in the direction you want to map.</p>

<a name="can-join-cant-host" /><h3>Why is my opponent unable to join a game when I challenge them even though I am able to accept challenges just fine?</h3>

<a name="can-host-cant-join" /><h3>Why am I able to host games just fine, but I am unable join others?</h3>

<p>It's possible that your computer's firewall is disallowing Flycast Dojo from sending or receiving connections. Check your Windows Firewall and make sure that <code>flycast.exe</code> is able to connect to all networks and that connections are allowed, both inbound and outbound.</p>

<a name="no-video" /><h3>My video is just a blank screen, but I am still able to hear sound. How do I fix this?</h3>

<p>In your <b>Video</b> settings, try switching between OpenGL and Vulkan rendering. To toggle this, there is a checkbox with the label <b>Use Vulkan Rendering</b>. Try turning it on and off. Ideal settings depend on your video card.</p>

<a name="set-defaults" /><h3>How do I reset my settings to their defaults?</h3>

<a name="cant-click" /><h3>My mouse and keyboard are unable to make any menu selections. What do I do?</h3>

<p>Delete the <code>emu.cfg</code> file in your flycast directory. If you are using Fightcade, you can find it at <code>Fightcade\emulator\flycast\emu.cfg</code>. One will be regenerated the next time you launch Flycast.</p>

<p>As of Flycast Dojo 0.4.1.0, upstream changes by Flycast have changed how mice and keyboards are defined. Deleting the <code>emu.cfg</code> redefines them upon regeneration.</p>

<a name="desync" /><h3>Why is my game desyncing? What can I do about it?</h3>

<p>Games desynchronize when your memory and opponent's memory have mismatched, leading to two different game states. Common causes include not loading the same ROM or BIOS, having different savestates or dipswitches, or using different builds of Flycast Dojo.</p>

<p>First, make sure that you and your opponent are using the same version of the software. What version of Flycast Dojo you use determines the common arcade dipswitches/VMUs are, as well as individual software builds. Next, <a href="https://github.com/blueminder/flycast-dojo/blob/master/README.md#md5-checksum-calculation--validation">validate your ROM against your opponent's ROM</a>.</p>

<p>If you are on Wi-Fi, the performance hit of it being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplex_(telecommunications)#Half_duplex">half duplex</a> has occasionally been known to cause desyncs between clients. It is recommended that you play on a wired network to ensure synchronization, and to generally not have a bad time.</p>

<p>In general, anything that can lead to a different memory state than your opponent would contribute to desyncs. For more information, check out <a href="https://www.smashladder.com/guides/view/26pv/desync-troubleshooting-guide">E2xD's Desync Troubleshooting Guide</a>. While Smash is a different scene, the causes for desyncs are much the same.</p>

<a name="crash" /><h3>Flycast crashes on launch. What do I do?</h3>

<p>Here are a few steps to help troubleshoot and diagnose what's going on.

<ol>
	<li>Delete the <code>emu.cfg</code> file.</li>
	<p>Sometimes, Fightcade upgrades or incompatible defaults in <code>emu.cfg</code> may cause crashes. Just delete <code>emu.cfg</code> from the same directory as <code>flycast.exe</code>. A new one will be generated the next time Flycast is launched. For Fightcade users, this will be in the <code>Fightcade\emulator\flycast</code> folder. Open Flycast after deleting the file and verify that the emulator works.</p>

	<li>Re-assign or delete controller mappings.</li>
	<p>Device-specific controls were fixed in a recent bug, but may be a culprit older mappings still exist. Be sure to set your controller mappings for both "Dreamcast Controls" and "Arcade Controls". You may also want to try deleting the contents of the <code>mappings/</code> directory and mapping your controls before launching a game.</p>

	<li>(Online Games & Replays) Check Windows Firewall.</li>
	<p>If a session isn't established within Fightcade, the client will automatically close Flycast. The firewall may be the culprit in this instance. To diagnose this, you can either temporarily disable Windows Firewall and try to start a replay or connect with your opponent. If this works, add a rule in Windows Firewall allowing Flycast to use your network.</p>

	<li>Report crash log.</li>
	<p>If none of the steps above worked, please run <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/debugview">DebugView</a>, replicate the crash, and send the log to me through the <code>#flycast-emulator</code> channel on the <a href="https://discord.gg/EyERRSg">Fightcade Discord</a> or via a <a href="https://github.com/blueminder/flycast-dojo/issues">GitHub issue</a>. Be sure to include Flycast Dojo version, your hardware specs and OS version.</p>
